# PWA Study Site — IT 3203 Milestone #1

This repo contains a basic information website for **Progressive Web Apps (PWA)** built with **HTML + CSS only** (no frameworks).

## Pages
- `index.html` — cover page with abstract, key terms, and table of contents
- `service-workers.html` — subtopic page
- `web-app-manifest.html` — subtopic page
- `key-concepts.html` — 5–7 key concepts
- `references.html` — references & learning resources
- `about.html` — about the student and project

A single stylesheet at `assets/styles.css` provides consistent design with Grid/Flex layout, hover effects, spacing, borders, colors, and font settings. Accessibility enhancements include a **skip link**, **ARIA landmarks**, and **active-page indicators**.
